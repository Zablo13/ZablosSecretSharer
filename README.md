# 🔐 Zablos Secret Sharer V3 OTP

**Zablos Secret Sharer V3** is a Python-based secret-sharing tool that splits a message into multiple parts ("shares").
Only when **all shares are combined** can the original message be reconstructed.

This tool supports both:

- **One-Time Pad (OTP)-style encryption** (2 shares)
- **Multi-party secret sharing** (more than 2 shares)

---

## Features

- Custom symbol-to-number mapping (0–99)
- Split messages into multiple code shares
- Reconstruct messages from all shares
- Perfect secrecy with 2-share mode (OTP)
- Pseudo-random OTP code generation with python's secrets - modul
- Save and load shares as `.json`
- Terminal-based interface

---

## How It Works

### Master Code Mapping

Characters (letters, digits, symbols) are converted into numbers using a fixed mapping (`mastercode`). This forms the basis for encryption and decryption.

### Encryption

- **2 Shares (OTP mode):**
  - You enter a secret key (`Code1`).
  - The tool calculates `Code2` such that:
    ```
    Message = (Code1 + Code2) mod 100
    ```
  - This mimics a One-Time Pad: perfectly secure if Code1 is random and used only once.

- **More than 2 Shares:**
  - Tool generates random shares (`Code2`, `Code3`, ..., `Code(N-1)`).
  - The final code is calculated so that all shares sum (mod 100) to the original message.

### Decryption

- Input **all shares**.
- The message is reconstructed by summing the numerical values of the shares (mod 100).
- Output is decoded back into readable characters.

## Example

### Encrypt (2-share mode)

```text
Message: Hello_World
Code1/2: use_good_random_numbers_here
→ Output: Code2/2: z²7/8G+B<Ö3ISHJ1IBJURED1ORER

Code1: use_good_random_numbers_here
Code2: z²7/8G+B<Ö3ISHJ1IBJURED1ORER
→ Message: Hello_World


🎲 Why secrets?
secrets uses system-level sources (/dev/urandom or CryptGenRandom) designed for crypto.
random is deterministic and predictable, even if seeded with time.
OTP security collapses if the pad isn’t truly random.


🛡️ Best Practices for OTP
Pad length ≥ message length (never shorter).
Never reuse pads (once used, discard forever).
Distribute pads securely (sending them alongside ciphertext breaks the whole system).
Store pads safely (offline, or in encrypted vaults).


📦 Requirements

Python 3.6+

No external dependencies (secrets, json, os are standard)
