# üîê Zablos Secret Sharer V3 OTP

**Zablos Secret Sharer V3** is a Python-based secret-sharing tool that splits a message into multiple parts ("shares").
Only when **all shares are combined** can the original message be reconstructed.

This tool supports both:

- **One-Time Pad (OTP)-style encryption** (2 shares)
- **Multi-party secret sharing** (more than 2 shares)

---

## Features

- Custom symbol-to-number mapping (0‚Äì99)
- Split messages into multiple code shares
- Reconstruct messages from all shares
- Perfect secrecy with 2-share mode (OTP)
- Pseudo-random OTP code generation with python's secrets - modul
- Save and load shares as `.json`
- Terminal-based interface

---

## How It Works

### Master Code Mapping

Characters (letters, digits, symbols) are converted into numbers using a fixed mapping (`mastercode`). This forms the basis for encryption and decryption.

### Encryption

- **2 Shares (OTP mode):**
  - You enter a secret key (`Code1`).
  - The tool calculates `Code2` such that:
    ```
    Message = (Code1 + Code2) mod 100
    ```
  - This mimics a One-Time Pad: perfectly secure if Code1 is random and used only once.

- **More than 2 Shares:**
  - Tool generates random shares (`Code2`, `Code3`, ..., `Code(N-1)`).
  - The final code is calculated so that all shares sum (mod 100) to the original message.

### Decryption

- Input **all shares**.
- The message is reconstructed by summing the numerical values of the shares (mod 100).
- Output is decoded back into readable characters.

## Example

### Encrypt (2-share mode)

```text
Message: Hello_World
Code1/2: use_good_random_numbers_here
‚Üí Output: Code2/2: z¬≤7/8G+B<√ñ3ISHJ1IBJURED1ORER

Code1: use_good_random_numbers_here
Code2: z¬≤7/8G+B<√ñ3ISHJ1IBJURED1ORER
‚Üí Message: Hello_World


üé≤ Why secrets?
secrets uses system-level sources (/dev/urandom or CryptGenRandom) designed for crypto.
random is deterministic and predictable, even if seeded with time.
OTP security collapses if the pad isn‚Äôt truly random.


üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices for OTP
Pad length ‚â• message length (never shorter).
Never reuse pads (once used, discard forever).
Distribute pads securely (sending them alongside ciphertext breaks the whole system).
Store pads safely (offline, or in encrypted vaults).


üì¶ Requirements

Python 3.6+

No external dependencies (secrets, json, os are standard)
